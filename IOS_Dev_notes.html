NSString *myString = @"Crystall Ball" ;

Get Familiar wit Xcode
	create a single view IOS applicaiton
	company identifier and product name make up bundle identifier
	com.jackzhao.ProductName
	Run xcode simulator

What is Label?
	anything you see from display can be called a "control". Label is a control
	main.storyboard helps you create a interface
	use search to find Label control
	create a label and change its attributes

Create a button
	select a button from utility secton in xcode

left upper corner is (x,y) = (0,0)
	x is getting bigger to right
	y is getting bigger to bottom

understanding views and view controller
	Anatomy of a UIView
		UIView has subviews
	View Controller
		Manage view reizing
		interacation with views
		handle events
		coordinating with data model or other view controllers
		View life cycle:
				view doesnt exist in memory
						|
					ViewDidLoad / ViewDidAppear
						|
					viewWillAppear
						|
					view Appears on Screen
						|
					viewWillDisappear
						|
					view not visible on screen
						|
					viewDidUnload
	CGRect and Frame
		UIVIew 
			Frame
				size
					width/height
				origin
					X/Y
		Open Xcode help documnetation: Command + option +shift + ?

		Use "IBAcation and IBOulte" to connect controls to our codes


Creating a Data Collection: NSArray
	 NSArray *predictions = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"It is Certain",
    @"It is decidedly so,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    @"My reply is so",
    @"It is doubtful",
    @"Better not tell you now",
    @"Unable to answer now",
    nil];

    create a @property.
    	create once and can be accessed anywhere
    	create @property in head file, then you access this property using self.xxxx in the implementation file
    		@property(strong, nonatomic) NSArray * prediction;
    			two qualifiers:
    				strong specifies an owning relationship to the destionation object
    				weak is the opposite
    				nonatomic: Tell complile not to use multi-threading
    				nonatomic is default

    Randomization
    	random(max_number);

Refactoring into a Model (MVC model-view-controller)
	create a custom class
		put data into model
		Single Responsibility Principle: Every class should have a single resposibility
		RightClick CrystallBall project Folder - new File under IOS tage - new Objective-C class
			it will create JZCrystallBall.h/m two files

	understanding @property (strong,nonatomic) NSArray *predictions;
		instance variable *_prediction will be automatically generated
			NSArray *_prediction; 
		getter and setter functions will automatic generate for predictions instance variable
			- (NSString*) predictions;
			- (void) SetPredictions: (NSArray*) newPredictions;
	We can explicity define our own getter and setter in class implemetation file


	readonly property @property (strong,nonatomic, readonly) NSArray *predictions;
		Now must specify intance variable
			NSArray *_prediction;

	forward declarion
		Never import class from interface file
			do @class CLASSNAME
			Then import CLASSNAME.h in the implementation file
				#import "CLASSNAME.h"

	Example:
		JZCrystallBall.h

				@interface JZCrystallBall : NSObject{
				    NSArray *_predictions;
				}

				@property (strong,nonatomic, readonly) NSArray *predictions;

				- (NSString *) randomPrediction;

				@end

		JZCrystabllBall.m

			#import "JZCrystallBall.h"

			@implementation JZCrystallBall
			-(NSArray *) predictions{
			    if(_predictions == Nil)
			        _predictions = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"It is Certain",
			                        @"It is decidedly so,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
			                        @"My reply is so",
			                        @"It is doubtful",
			                        @"Better not tell you now",
			                        @"Unable to answer now",
			                        nil];
			    return _predictions;
			}

			- (NSString *) randomPrediction{
			    int randomNumber = arc4random_uniform(self.predictions.count);
			    return [_predictions objectAtIndex:randomNumber];
			    //return Nil;
			}

			@end
