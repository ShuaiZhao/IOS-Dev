Creating a Data Collection: NSArray
	 NSArray *predictions = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"It is Certain",
    @"It is decidedly so,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    @"My reply is so",
    @"It is doubtful",
    @"Better not tell you now",
    @"Unable to answer now",
    nil];

    create a @property.
    	create once and can be accessed anywhere
    	create @property in head file, then you access this property using self.xxxx in the implementation file
    		@property(strong, nonatomic) NSArray * prediction;
    			two qualifiers:
    				strong specifies an owning relationship to the destionation object
    				weak is the opposite
    				nonatomic: Tell complile not to use multi-threading
    				nonatomic is default
